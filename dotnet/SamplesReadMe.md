# Getting Started for .NET

This repo contains sample applications written in C# that run on Google Cloud Platform. The applications make use of two client libraries:

* [.NET Cloud Client Library]
* [Google API Client Library]

## aspnet (can we call this repo something else than aspnet?)

The [aspnet] directory contains complete examples that you can build and run today. The samples are built on ASP.NET 4.5.2.

## core (can we call this repo something else than core?)

The [core] directory is a work in progress. The samples are build on ASP.NET 5.
