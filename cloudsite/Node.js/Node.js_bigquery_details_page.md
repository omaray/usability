# BigQuery
Node.js

Learn about using the BigQuery API with Node.js

Querying massive datasets can be time consuming and expensive without the right hardware and infrastructure. Google BigQuery solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries against append-only tables using the processing power of Google&#39;s infrastructure. To learn more about BigQuery, see [What is BigQuery?](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery)

* Read the [getting started guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sign-up).
* Learn how to develop using the [Node.js client library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-node).
* Interact with the API in the browser, using [Google APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/bigquery/v2/)
