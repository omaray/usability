Learn about using the BigQuery API with Python

Querying massive datasets can be time consuming and expensive without the right hardware and infrastructure. Google BigQuery solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries against append-only tables using the processing power of Google&#39;s infrastructure. To learn more about BigQuery, see [What is BigQuery?](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery)

* Read the [getting started guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sign-up).
* Learn how to develop using the [Python client library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-python).
* Interact with the API in the browser, using [Google APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/bigquery/v2/)

## Install the gcloud-python library
To install the Python library, you must use [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
