Getting started
---------------
The ``gax`` library will allow you to connect to the `Google PubSub API`_ and access all its methods.

.. _Google PubSub API: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/

In order to achieve so you need to setup your authentication as well as install the ``gax`` library.

Setup Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To authenticate all your API calls, first install and setup the `Google Cloud SDK`_.

.. _Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

Once done, you can then run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud auth login


Install Gax Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``gax`` library is ``pip`` install-able:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo pip install gax-google-pubsub-v1

At this point you are all set to continue.
